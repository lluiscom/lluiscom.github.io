# Lluís Colomé Portfolio

## Project Analysis

### User Profile
My portfolio website is aimed at **tech industry recruiters** or **hiring managers** who are looking for new talent in computer engineering, specifically with strengths in web development and software engineering.
My goal is to make it easy for users and recruiters to quickly understand my strengths, skill set, and previous projects so people can see that I have the communication and technical skills needed for a fast-paced, innovative team.

### Information Architecture
The website is organized into several sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of my professional profile. At the top, a **profile section** introduces me with a photo, a friendly greeting, and a brief description. This section allows users to quickly gain insight into my background and motivations. Following this is the **My Skills** section, which showcases my technical competencies, categorized into various areas such as Engineering & Design, C & C++ Programming, and Web Development with frameworks like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Each skill set includes brief descriptions and links for further exploration. Next, the **My Projects** section highlights two significant projects with detailed descriptions to showcase my experience and practical application of my skills. Finally, the page offers **contact information and social media links**, making it easy for potential employers to connect with me. Additionally, a sidebar menu provides quick navigation across the sections, enhancing the user experience by allowing users to jump to their area of interest with ease.

### Visual Design
The visual design of this portfolio emphasizes **simplicity and readability**, using a **neutral color palette** that adapts between light and dark modes for accessibility. Key colors include soft grays and subtle highlights, creating a professional look while ensuring the text remains readable across devices and lighting conditions. The **Montserrat font** was chosen for its modern, clean look that pairs well with the minimalistic aesthetic of the site. Key interactive elements, such as skill cards and project previews, include subtle animations (like hover effects and smooth transitions) that create a dynamic user experience without overwhelming the viewer. The profile image is prominently placed at the top, serving as a focal point that establishes a personal connection with the visitor. Additionally, the sidebar menu with a "hamburger" icon for toggling was integrated to maintain a compact layout, especially on mobile devices, enhancing the user’s ability to navigate easily. These design choices aim to create a visually appealing and professional portfolio that reflects my attention to detail and user-centered approach.
